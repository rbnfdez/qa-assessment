# QA Assessment — Free Agent Skill
> A conversational QA maturity assessment for AI agents. Ask your agent to run it — it interviews your team, scores 6 dimensions, and gives you a radar chart with actionable recommendations in ~5 minutes.
---
## ⚠️ This is not a CLI tool
This is an **AI agent skill** — it runs inside your AI coding assistant (Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, etc.), not in your terminal.
Your terminal is only used to **install** it. After that, you talk to your agent.
---
## Installation
Run this once in your terminal:
```bash
npx skills add qevolution/qassessment
```
The installer will ask you which agents to install to (Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, Copilot, etc.) and whether to install at project or global level.

---
## How to use it
**After installation, open your AI agent and start the skill:**

| Agent | How to run it |
| --- | --- |
| **Claude Code** | Type `/qa-assessment` in the chat |
| **Cursor** | Type `Run the QA assessment` in the chat (`Cmd+L`) |
| **Windsurf** | Type `Run the QA assessment` in Cascade |
| **GitHub Copilot** | Type `Run the QA assessment` in the chat (`Cmd+Shift+I`) |
| **Cline** | Type `Run the QA assessment` in the Cline panel |
| **Codex** | Type `Run the QA assessment` in the chat |

That's it. The agent takes over from there.
It will:
1. Welcome you and explain the process
2. Ask 12 questions one at a time (you answer in natural language — no forms, no clicks)
3. Score your answers across 6 quality dimensions
4. Show you a radar chart with your maturity level
5. Give you 3 concrete recommendations based on your weakest areas
> 💡 The skill auto-detects the language you write in. Answer in English → assessment in English. Answer in Spanish → assessment in Spanish.

## What the assessment covers
12 questions across 6 dimensions, based on the QPAM framework and validated QA consulting criteria:
| # | Dimension | What it evaluates |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 🏢 Culture & Feedback | Retrospectives, technical debt, process improvement |
| 2 | 🎯 Quality Ownership | When QA gets involved, Quality Engineering vs. traditional testing |
| 3 | 🧪 Testing Strategy | Coverage, test breadth (unit → E2E), exploratory testing |
| 4 | 🤖 Automation & Tools | Automation strategy, tooling, best practices |
| 5 | 🚀 CI/CD & Deployment | Deployment frequency, pipeline automation, infrastructure |
| 6 | 📊 Monitoring & Incidents | Error detection, alerting, incident management, post-mortems |
### Maturity levels
| Level | Label | Score |
| --- | --- | --- |
| L1 | 🔴 Initial | 1.0 – 1.9 |
| L2 | 🟠 Basic | 2.0 – 2.9 |
| L3 | 🟡 Intermediate | 3.0 – 3.5 |
